# GitX

GitX is an git CLI extension for personal use.
Makes for easier git commands much like aliases but with more functionality.

## Useage
Checkout first does a `git fetch`, then lists all branches including remotes with `git branch -a`.  The CLI allows you to select a branch, then `git checkout <branch> --track`, then a `git pull`.

```gitx checkout <branch>```
